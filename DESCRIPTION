Description: A new object oriented programming system designed to be a successor 
  to S3 and S4. It includes formal class, generic, and method specification, 
  and a limited form of multiple dispatch. It has been designed and implemented 
  collaboratively by the R Consortium Object-Oriented Programming Working Group, 
  which includes representatives from R-Core, 'Bioconductor', 
  'Posit'/'tidyverse', and the wider R community.
